# Exploring Drawer and Sheet Components in shadcn UI

In web applications, overlays like drawers and sheets provide accessible, focused spaces for actions or additional information. The Drawer and Sheet components in shadcn UI are highly customizable, ideal for creating dynamic panels, modals, and sidebars. Let’s dive into setting up and customizing each.

## Use Cases

### Drawer

The Drawer component is perfect for scenarios where users need quick access to navigation or additional options without leaving the current view:

- Side navigation menus in dashboards
- Filters or settings that slide in from the side
- Forms that need to remain visible without blocking the main view

### Sheet

The Sheet component offers more flexibility than a drawer, making it ideal for:

- Full-screen overlays on mobile devices
- Detailed modals with adjustable sizes and positioning
- Content that requires user focus, such as forms, account details, or settings panels

## Installation

To add the Drawer and Sheet components to your project, use the following CLI commands:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add drawer
npx shadcn@latest add sheet
```


These commands will install the necessary files and dependencies for each component.

## Drawer Component

### Basic Structure and Tag Explanation

The Drawer component in shadcn UI is composed of the following tags:

- Drawer: The main container for the drawer.
- DrawerTrigger: The button or link that toggles the drawer.
- DrawerContent: Holds the content within the drawer, including optional header and footer sections.
- DrawerHeader, DrawerTitle, and DrawerDescription: Provide structured headers within the drawer.
- DrawerFooter: Contains action buttons like submit or cancel.
- DrawerClose: A button to close the drawer.

### Example Setup

Here’s a basic drawer setup:

```typescript
import {
  Drawer,
  DrawerTrigger,
  DrawerContent,
  DrawerHeader,
  DrawerTitle,
  DrawerDescription,
  DrawerFooter,
  DrawerClose,
} from "@/components/ui/drawer";

function AppDrawer() {
  return (
    <Drawer>
      <DrawerTrigger>Open Drawer</DrawerTrigger>
      <DrawerContent>
        <DrawerHeader>
          <DrawerTitle>Confirm Action</DrawerTitle>
          <DrawerDescription>This action is irreversible.</DrawerDescription>
        </DrawerHeader>
        <DrawerFooter>
          <button>Confirm</button>
          <DrawerClose>Cancel</DrawerClose>
        </DrawerFooter>
      </DrawerContent>
    </Drawer>
  );
}
```

### Customization Options

- Positioning: Use CSS to style DrawerContent to adjust width or padding.
- Responsive Dialog: Combine Drawer with the Dialog component to make it responsive on mobile devices​(Drawer - shadcn_ui).

### Drawer with Dialog

To create a responsive drawer-dialog, you can render a Dialog component on desktop and Drawer on mobile:

```typescript
<Drawer>
  <DrawerTrigger>Open Drawer</DrawerTrigger>
  <DrawerContent>
    {/* Drawer content here */}
  </DrawerContent>
</Drawer>
```

This setup ensures users on smaller screens get the drawer experience, while larger screens display it as a dialog.

## Sheet Component

The Sheet component builds on the Dialog and is ideal for overlays that complement the main content. It can appear from any side and offers more extensive customization options than the Drawer.

### Basic Structure and Tag Explanation

The Sheet’s main elements include:

- Sheet: The primary container.
- SheetTrigger: Opens the sheet.
- SheetContent: Holds the sheet's content.
- SheetHeader, SheetTitle, and SheetDescription: Provides structured headers.

### Example Setup

Here’s how to set up a basic Sheet:

```typescript
import {
  Sheet,
  SheetTrigger,
  SheetContent,
  SheetHeader,
  SheetTitle,
  SheetDescription,
} from "@/components/ui/sheet";

function AppSheet() {
  return (
    <Sheet>
      <SheetTrigger>Open Sheet</SheetTrigger>
      <SheetContent>
        <SheetHeader>
          <SheetTitle>Important Action</SheetTitle>
          <SheetDescription>
            Are you sure you want to proceed with this action?
          </SheetDescription>
        </SheetHeader>
      </SheetContent>
    </Sheet>
  );
}
```

### Customization Options for Sheet

- Side: Use the side prop in SheetContent to control where the sheet appears. Available options include top, right, bottom, and left.

```typescript
<SheetContent side="right">
  {/* Content */}
</SheetContent>
```

- Size: Adjust the size of the sheet using custom CSS classes. Here’s an example of setting a custom width:

```typescript
<SheetContent className="w-[400px] sm:w-[540px]">
  {/* Content */}
</SheetContent>
```

- Other Props: The Sheet component supports standard dialog-related props, such as adjusting overlay behavior, animations, and accessibility settings

### Sheet with Side and Size Adjustments

Here’s an example with a right-aligned sheet and a custom width:

```typescript
<Sheet>
  <SheetTrigger>Open Custom Sheet</SheetTrigger>
  <SheetContent side="right" className="w-[500px]">
    <SheetHeader>
      <SheetTitle>Settings</SheetTitle>
      <SheetDescription>Adjust your preferences</SheetDescription>
    </SheetHeader>
    {/* Sheet Content */}
  </SheetContent>
</Sheet>
```
