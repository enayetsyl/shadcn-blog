Buttons are essential elements in any web application, serving as interactive triggers for various actions. The Button component in shadcn UI is highly customizable, offering a range of variants, styles, and configurations. This post will guide you through the Button component’s use cases, setup, variants, customization, and a comprehensive example to help you make the most of this versatile component.

## Use Cases

The Button component can be used in multiple contexts, including:

- Primary Actions: Highlighting the main call-to-action, like “Submit” or “Save.”
- Secondary Actions: Providing supporting actions, such as “Cancel” or “Back.”
- Destructive Actions: Used for actions that delete or alter data, like “Delete” or “Remove.”
- Icon Buttons: Ideal for actions represented by icons, such as search or close.

## Installation

Install the Button component using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

This command will install the necessary files and dependencies for the Button component.

## Button Variants with Examples

shadcn UI offers several Button variants, each suited to different design requirements and user actions. Let’s explore each variant with examples.

1. Primary Button (Default)

The primary button is ideal for the main actions on a page, like submitting a form.

```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

<Button>Primary Action</Button>
```
2. Link Button

A link button functions as a hyperlink and can navigate users to different sections or pages.

```typescript
<Button as="a" href="/home">Go to Home</Button>
```

3. Secondary Button

The secondary button is for actions that support the primary one, such as canceling or going back.

```typescript
<Button variant="secondary">Secondary Action</Button>
```

4. Destructive Button

This button is used for actions with potential negative consequences, like deleting data.

```typescript
<Button variant="destructive">Delete</Button>
```

5. Outline Button

Outline buttons are visually subtle, making them ideal for actions that are less prominent.

```typescript
<Button variant="outline">Outline Button</Button>
```

6. Ghost Button

Ghost buttons are minimally styled and blend with the background, used for actions that don’t need visual emphasis.

```typescript
<Button variant="ghost">Ghost Button</Button>
```

7. Icon Button

Use icon buttons for actions represented by icons, such as search, settings, or closing modals.

```typescript
import { Search } from "lucide-react";

<Button variant="icon">
  <Search />
</Button>
```

8. Button with Icon

Combine text and icons for buttons that need a visual cue, like adding a “+” icon to an “Add” button.

```typescript
import { Plus } from "lucide-react";

<Button>
  <Plus className="mr-2" />
  Add Item
</Button>
```

9. Loading Button

Use this for actions in progress, giving users visual feedback with a loading spinner.

```typescript
<Button disabled>
  <span className="spinner-border spinner-border-sm mr-2" role="status" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  Loading
</Button>
```

10. Button as Child

Buttons can wrap other elements, like links, when asChild is set.

```typescript
<Button asChild>
  <a href="/profile">View Profile</a>
</Button>
```

## Customizing the Button

The Button component is highly customizable using Tailwind CSS or inline styles. Here are some common customizations:

### Customizing Colors and Background

You can change the background color, text color, or border for each button variant by applying custom Tailwind classes or updating the button component styling in your project.

```typescript
<Button className="bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700">Custom Primary</Button>
```

### Adjusting Padding and Margins

Tailwind classes make it easy to adjust spacing around the button.

```typescript
<Button className="px-4 py-2">Extra Padding</Button>
```

### Adding Hover and Active States

Customize hover, focus, or active states using Tailwind’s pseudo-classes.

```typescript
<Button className="bg-gray-500 hover:bg-gray-600 active:bg-gray-700">Interactive Button</Button>
```

### Using CSS Variables

For more flexibility, set up custom CSS variables in your global CSS file.

```css
:root {
  --button-bg-color: #3498db;
  --button-hover-color: #2980b9;
}
```

Then apply these in your component:

```typescript
<Button className="bg-[var(--button-bg-color)] hover:bg-[var(--button-hover-color)]">
  Custom CSS Variable Button
</Button>
```

### Comprehensive Example

Here’s a form with various buttons, showcasing different variants and use cases:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Plus, Trash } from "lucide-react";

function ExampleForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Manage Account</h2>
      
      {/* Primary Button */}
      <Button>Save Changes</Button>

      {/* Secondary Button */}
      <Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>

      {/* Destructive Button */}
      <Button variant="destructive" className="ml-2">
        <Trash className="mr-2" />
        Delete Account
      </Button>

      {/* Link Button */}
      <Button as="a" href="/help" variant="link" className="ml-2">
        Help
      </Button>

      {/* Button with Icon */}
      <Button variant="primary" className="ml-2">
        <Plus className="mr-2" />
        Add Item
      </Button>

      {/* Loading Button */}
      <Button disabled className="ml-2">
        <span className="spinner-border spinner-border-sm mr-2" role="status" aria-hidden="true"></span>
